## ⚙️ Capacity & Usage Notes

This application uses Firebase (Spark / Free plan) for real-time data sync.

- There is no hard-coded limit on hosts or participants.
- For smooth performance on the free tier, ~20–50 participants per room is recommended.
- Actual capacity depends on Firebase read/write usage and real-time listeners.

For larger-scale or public events, upgrading the Firebase plan or optimizing listeners is recommended.
